    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she
      wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. Since
      she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I
      couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. These
      brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare cookie layer: Beat 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup
        white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl until creamy. Add
        one egg; beat until light and creamy, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and baking soda in a bowl.
        Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is
        combined. Stir chocolate chips into dough. Spread dough evenly into the
        prepared baking dish; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare brownie layer: Stir 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, and 1
        teaspoon vanilla in a bowl; add two eggs and beat well. Mix in cocoa
        powder until well-combined. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, baking powder, and
        1/8 teaspoon salt until batter is combined. Pour over cookie layer and
        spread to cover completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into
        20 bars. Enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>
